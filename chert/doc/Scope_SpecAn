A scope has time per div, stream sampling rate, pixels per div
  Generally there is either decimation or interpolation.
   
A specan has base settings of start/stop and RBW.
  These dictate an input sample rate and number of samples.
  
It seems reasonable to assert that the information on the two (roughly same sized) screens will be similar.

Use case 1:
  The scope sets tpdiv, ppdiv  This is, by definition, a resampled waveform.  The most sensible use of the specan then
  is that it just sets a zero-base in the spec-an.  It also sets an FS/2 span, getting a vision of the spectrum means
  that the specan settings are going for a ride.  No problem, easy peasey.

Use case 2:
  The specan is in charge.
    If you zoom way in on a little tiny piece of spectrum, you might want to make an envelope in the scope.
    You can set a wide RBW and have a not-full screen.  On the time-domain side RBW equates to screen time span
      regardless of sample rate.
  Well, so I have to do the work to figure the number of samples and duration to satisfy the specan settings.
  I don't want to do a bandpass resample, not just yet, so I'll just dictate Nyquist to the RBW to grab the
    length of time.  Then I'll only do the number of sine waves to get the RBW/bin count to cover the
    screen.
    Back in the time domain, there will have to be a resample. to get whatever that length is down to
      the length of the screen.
