WaveFile

0 – File System is done only by unistd, it has everything.

1 – Next up is chunks, they have a nice class.  They get put into a memory image that skips the data chunk but grabs an image of the other chunks.

2 – Next up is chunk handlers.  I have a WAVE chunk handler (trivial, hierarchical only) and a fmt_ handler.  The fmt_ handler is only for uncompressed formats.

3 – Next up is where we provide multiple interfaces.  This hides the chunk and file-system
